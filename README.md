# Predicting maximal work capacity of cancer survivors expressed in watts (W) 

## Introduction
After surgery and drug therapy, the cancer patients should undergo physical and sport therapy in order to regain lost physical capacity (strength, endurance, flexibility and etc.). In order to tailor optimal training's plan for every patient individualy, we need to geather information about fitness status of the person. One of the test we have performed in the rehabilitation clinic was cycle ergometry test which is suitable for cardiorespiratory and aerobic fitnees diagnostic. 

During my work as a sport therapist 
## Models
Three models (Linear Regression, Support Vector Regressor and Random Forest Regressor) are used to predict maximal Watt performace which can be obtained during maximal cycle ergometry test. Four attributes (Age, body weight, body height and body mass index (BMI)) are used to predict outcome variable (WATTmax).
