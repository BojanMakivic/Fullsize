# Predicting maximal work capacity of cancer survivors
## Introduction
After they finish surgery and drug therapy, the cancer patients should undergo physical and sport therapy in order to regain lost physical capacity (strength, endurance, flexibility and etc.). In order to tailor optimal training's plan for every patient individualy, we enter the process of information geathering considering a fitness status of the person. One quite common test that is performed in the clinical setup is cycle ergometry test which is suitable for cardiorespiratory and aerobic fitnees assessment. 
Adventages of this test are many ranging from reliability and validity of the test to accuracy and easy interpretation. On the other hand disadvantages are mostly related to organizational, time-management and cost aspects.

## Models
Three models (Linear Regression, Support Vector Regressor and Random Forest Regressor) are used to predict maximal Watt performace which can be obtained during maximal cycle ergometry test. Four attributes (Age, body weight, body height and body mass index (BMI)) are used to predict outcome variable (WATTmax).
